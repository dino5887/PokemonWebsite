                    Starter Pokémon, or Starters, are the Pokémon a Trainer chooses at the 
                    beginning of their Pokémon journey and the main protagonists of the Pokémon 
                    series of games. In each generation of Pokémon games, a set of Starter Pokémon 
                    are available for new Trainers to choose from in sets of three; the types that 
                    make up these sets are Fire, Grass, and Water. Each starter Pokémon has three 
                    evolutionary forms.
                    Picking a Pokémon to start off any game can be difficult. But There
                    are no "right" starter Pokemon to choose.

                    Before picking a starter, onsider your play style and game type.
                    If you choose melee, go for the fire-type. They can learn many strong melee moves.
                    If you go for tactical (ranged, in other games) then choose water-type. 
                    They are very good at not making melee contact with enemies, 
                    giving them an advantage over Pokémon that rely on abilities like rough skin.
                    If you prefer taking advantage of the enemies' weaknesses, then use the 
                    grass-type. They have moves such as leech seed that drain equal 
                    amounts of health regardless of type and level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the starter Pokémon, after evolving, gets an additional type for itself 
                    (like Charmeleon gets Fire and Flying-type after it evolves into Charizard 
                    and Mudkip gets Water and Ground-type after it evolves into a Marshtomp), 
                    you may think about preferring that Pokémon because it may cover up many of 
                    its weaknesses.
