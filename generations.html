                Each generation brought new features, new Pokemon, and added new ways for 
                Pokemon to battle and for you to develop your relationship with them. 
                But which one is the best to start with?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a completely subjective question, and there's really no wrong answer. 
                The difficulty of the Pokemon series is geared so they can be enjoyed by fans 
                of all ages, so most people who give the series a try won't find themselves 
                in a position where they don't know what to do. Newer Pokemon games have 
                features that make leveling Pokemon and other actions more convenient, but 
                there's a lot to be said for starting with the basics.
