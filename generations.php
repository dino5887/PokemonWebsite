                "Gen" is short for "generation" and refers to the time period in which a specific game was released.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each generation brought new features, new Pokemon, and added new ways for
                Pokemon to battle and for you to develop your relationship with them.
                But which one is the best to start with?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a completely subjective question, and there's really no wrong answer.
                The difficulty of the Pokemon series is geared so they can be enjoyed by fans
                of all ages, so most people who give the series a try won't find themselves
                in a position where they don't know what to do. Newer Pokemon games have
                features that make leveling Pokemon and other actions more convenient, but
                there's a lot to be said for starting with the basics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout each generation, there is usually a theme to the region introduced in a specific generation.
                As a result, each region and generation have several key features, such as important Pokémon and places,
                that
                place emphasis on those themes. In particular, the very last Pokémon introduced in that region and in
                that generation
                embody that generation's theme in some way.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, generation 1 is geared towards science. The starters of the Kanto region, Bulbasaur,
                Charmander, and Squirtle,
                are all based on animals that existed on Earth thousands of years ago (mammalian reptiles, salamanders,
                and turtles respectively).
                Eevee (the Evolution Pokémon) and its first three Eeveelutions were introduced here. There is a museum
                in Pewter City where fossil
                Pokémon may be revived. Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon, is introduced in this generation. Mewtwo is a
                genetics experiment gone wrong in a
                similar vein as Frankenstein. The generation's final two Pokémon, Mewtwo and Mew, embody the two main
                aspects of science that are covered in that region:
                technology and genetics respectively.
