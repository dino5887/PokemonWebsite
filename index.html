                    Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokémon, 
                    albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, 
                    when the Game Boy was released. The concept of the Pokémon universe, 
                    in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, 
                    stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which 
                    Tajiri enjoyed as a child.
                </p>

                    Players are designated as Pokémon 
                    Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional Pokédex 
                    by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional 
                    region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokédex by 
                    transferring Pokémon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful 
                    Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other 
                    Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokémon League and become the 
                    regional Champion. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are 
                    present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the 
                    video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to 
                    raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many non-player character (NPC) Trainers 
                    and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a 
                    specific region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to journey through, 
                    completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling 
                    the plans of an evil team of Pokémon Trainers who serve as antagonists to 
                    the player). Excluding Pokémon Sun and Moon and Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra 
                    Moon, the games feature eight powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, 
                    that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer 
                    receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is 
                    eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four talented trainers 
                    (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to four 
                    Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, 
                    they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously 
                    defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion.
                </p>
                <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the consistent aspects of most Pokémon games—spanning from Pokémon Red 
                    and Blue on the Game Boy to the Nintendo 3DS games Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra 
                    Moon—is the choice of one of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's 
                    adventures; these three are often labeled "starter Pokémon". Players can 
                    choose a Pokémon type — Grass-type, Fire-type, or Water-type Pokémon indigenous 
                    to that particular region. For example, in Pokémon Red and Blue, the player 
                    has the choice of starting with Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle. The exception 
                    to this rule is Pokémon Yellow, where players are given a Pikachu, an Electric-type 
                    mouse Pokémon, famous for being the mascot of the Pokémon media franchise; unique 
                    to Pokémon Yellow, the three starter Pokémon from Red and Blue can be obtained 
                    during the quest by a single player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose the type 
                    that has a type advantage over the player's chosen Pokémon as their starter Pokémon 
                    (excluding Sun and Moon and Sword and Shield.). For instance, if the player picks 
                    the Fire-type Charmander, the rival will always pick the Water-type Squirtle. 
                    This does not affect the first battle between the rivals, as they can only use 
                    Normal-type attacks at this point, meaning that they cannot exploit weaknesses. 
                    The exception to this is again Pokémon Yellow, in which the rival picks Eevee, a 
                    Normal-type Pokémon with multiple evolutions. Sun and Moon also is an exception 
                    is this rule, as the rival picks the starter weak toward the player's starter, 
                    with the Pokémon that has the type advantage going to a trainer in the Champion 
                    battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, in Pokémon Black and White, there are two rivals; 
                    one picks the Pokémon with a type advantage over the player's chosen Pokémon, 
                    while the other chooses the Pokémon with the type disadvantage. 
                    In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, another Trainer chooses the Pokémon 
                    with a type disadvantage to the player's chosen Pokémon, but never battles the 
                    player; instead, this character battles alongside the player as a tag partner 
                    in certain situations.
                    The situation is similar in Pokémon X and Y, but there are four rivals. 
                    Two of them receive the starter Pokémon in an arrangement similar to 
                    Pokémon Black and White, but the other two have completely different 
                    Pokémon.
                </p>
                <h2>Keep Your Pokemon Healed!</h2>
                <p>
                    It's essential to keep your Pokemon in tip-top shape, 
                    so you'll always be prepared for battle. No matter how strong you think your 
                    Pokemon are, there are always flukes in which a full health bar might mean 
                    the difference between surviving an attack or losing a battle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pokemon is an RPG (role-playing game), so although each attack will do 
                    roughly the same damage most of the time, the actual damage is determined 
                    at random between a lower and higher range of damage. Additionally, there 
                    are type-weaknesses, and critical hits which cause twice the damage to worry 
                    about. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pokemon can be healed with a plethera of items such as potions, water bottles,
                    revives, restores, etc. If your Pokemon faints, you will need a revive or a 
                    Pokecenter in order to heal it. However, to ensure that your Pokemon don't reach 
                    this critical conditions, use potions and other HP healing items in order to 
                    keep their health up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Pokemon's happiness also figures into several of the series' features. 
                    If you let your Pokemon faint often their happiness and friendliness with you 
                    will decrease, which can affect their stats or even their opportunity to evolve. 
                    Just keep them healed by visiting a PokeCenter when you enter a town. 
                    It's for your Pokemon's health. 
                </p>
                <h2>Catch Em' All!</h2>
                <p>
                    Besides becoming the Pokemon Champion, there is an underlying goal in each game 
                    to fill your Pokedex by catching one of each Pokemon available. 
                    This goal becomes loftier the newer the game is, with the 1st gen games 
                    having only 150 Pokemon needed to complete their Pokedex, and the latest 
                    6th Gen having a whopping 719 Pokemon you'll need to find to truly catch 
                    them all. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also might have an opportunity to catch very rare Pokemon called
                    "Shiny Pokemon." Starting with Gen 2, wild Pokemon had a very small 
                    chance to appear in battle with a different color scheme and a special 
                    shiny animation. These Pokemon are extremely rare, and one of even the 
                    most common Pokemon in shiny form can give you incredible leverage when 
                    it comes to trading for a Pokemon you want (though you should probably 
                    just keep it.)

                <h2>Go Play!</h2>
                <p>
                    How you play the game is up to you. 
                    Pokemon games don't have time limits, and they don't have rigid 
                    objectives. Each event in the story will wait as long as you take to 
                    get to it and once you actually complete the story and side quests, 
                    you're free to roam the world at will. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set your own goals! You can hunt for shiny Pokemon, try to beat the game 
                    with only one Pokemon, or a team of the weakest Pokemon. 
                    The possibilities are limitless!
