            <h1>How to Pick a Starter Pokemon</h1>
        </header>
        <article class = "article_spacing">
            <p>
                Starter Pokémon, or Starters, are the Pokémon a Trainer chooses at the
                beginning of their Pokémon journey and the main protagonists of the Pokémon
                series of games. In each generation of Pokémon games, a set of Starter Pokémon
                are available for new Trainers to choose from in sets of three; the types that
                make up these sets are Fire, Grass, and Water. Each starter Pokémon has three
                evolutionary forms.
                Picking a Pokémon to start off any game can be difficult. But There
                are no "right" starter Pokemon to choose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before picking a starter, onsider your play style and game type.
                If you choose melee, go for the fire-type. They can learn many strong melee moves.
                If you go for tactical (ranged, in other games) then choose water-type.
                They are very good at not making melee contact with enemies,
                giving them an advantage over Pokémon that rely on abilities like rough skin.
                If you prefer taking advantage of the enemies' weaknesses, then use the
                grass-type. They have moves such as leech seed that drain equal
                amounts of health regardless of type and level.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the starter Pokémon, after evolving, gets an additional type for itself
                (like Charmeleon gets Fire and Flying-type after it evolves into Charizard
                and Mudkip gets Water and Ground-type after it evolves into a Marshtomp),
                you may think about preferring that Pokémon because it may cover up many of
                its weaknesses.
            </p>    
            <p>In Pokémon Green, Pokémon Red and Blue, and Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, the player receives one of the Kanto starters Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle as his first Pokémon from Professor Oak. The player's rival receives the starter Pokémon whose type is stronger against the player's chosen starter. </p>
            <p>These Starter Pokémon first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver where Professor Elm allows the player character to choose one of them. The rival of the player character takes the starter that is strongest against the player's. The same situation was present in Pokémon Crystal. In the remakes, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the starters get a redesign. Now the chosen starter, as well as any other Pokémon that is first in the player's party, can follow the player character by walking behind them. </p>
            <p>In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, after Professor Birch is rescued from a PoochyenaRSORAS or ZigzagoonE, he allows the player to keep the Pokémon they chose to rescue him with the choice between Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip. </p>
            <p>The Sinnoh Starter Pokémon can be picked out of three Pokémon that new trainers will obtain in their journey which cannot be found in the Sinnoh Region itself. The three starter Pokémon are: Turtwig the grass-type Pokémon, Chimchar the fire-type Pokémon and Piplup the water-type Pokémon. In the distant past of the Sinnoh region, trainers a given a starter Pokémon from other regions by a traveling Pokémon Professor, being Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawott. </p>
            <p>The Unova Starter Pokémon can be picked out of three Pokémon that cannot be found in the Unova Region. The three starter Pokémon are: Snivy a grass-type Pokémon, Oshawott a water-type Pokémon and Tepig a fire type Pokémon. These have the abilities: Overgrow that will increase the Pokémon grass moves when the Pokémon has only 30% of its HP left, Torrent that will increase the Pokémon water moves when the Pokémon has only 30% of its HP left and Blaze that will increase the Pokémon fire type moves when the Pokémon has only 30% of its HP left. </p>
            <p>In Pokémon Sun and Moon and Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, after returning from Mahalo Trail and arrive back in Iki Town, the Kahuna of Melemele Island, Hala/Professor Kukui, will offer the Starter Pokémon to choose from. A ceremony will occur after choosing the first Pokémon. Hau will always have the Pokémon that is the weakest to the chosen starter. </p>
            <p>In Pokémon Sword and Shield, Leon, the Champion of the Galar Pokémon League, offers the player a choice of Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble as their first Partner Pokémon. The players' rival Hop (who is Leon's younger brother) will choose the Pokémon with a type disadvantage to the player's choice. Leon takes the remaining Pokémon into his care, eventually using its final form in the Championship Match against the player. </p>
